# No MLOps
We are just building a quick prototype model or, say, PoC for our objective. We do not have following for this stage

- No experiment tracking
- No model management
- No Model Registry or Deployment

We are currently logging the model performance metrics and brief info manually as below. It becomes chaotic after a point to manage experiments manually, no reproducibilty as we are not tracking model parameters, hyper-params etc. No lineage is being tracked.
